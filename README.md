# depth_rendering
Here's a project I completed that accomplishes several examples of rendering that takes depth specifically into account

Download it, open render.html in the root folder, toggle between the different rendering methods with the top right red button, and use shift+mouse movement to alter the point of focus.

Standard setting: no unique fragment shaders applied
Foveated setting: Blurring around the point of focus to replicate the natural loss of acuity of the human eye
DoF: Blur based on the depth of a fragment relative to the point of focus
Try out wearing 3D glasses if you've got them to experience the anaglyph rendering!
